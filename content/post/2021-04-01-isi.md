We have presented STELLA at [ISI 2021 - 16th International Symposium for Information Science](https://isi2021.net/)!

In our talk, we provide an updated overview of the STELLA infrastructure and outline how participants can contribute to the living lab experiments.

It was held before our [CLEF2021 lab](https://clef-lilas.github.io/) in order to promote the infrastructure and discuss it with an expert community.
