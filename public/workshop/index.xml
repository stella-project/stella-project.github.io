      <description>Scope With this workshop, we want to inform future collaborators about the outcomes and the state-of-the-art evaluations based on the STELLA platform. Furthermore, we as the project organizers want to learn about the use cases and ideas of our collaborators. Ultimately, we aim at developing ideas for upcoming projects and collaborations. The event is planned to be held as a Â½ day workshop.
Update: A blog post about the outcomes can be found here.</description>
